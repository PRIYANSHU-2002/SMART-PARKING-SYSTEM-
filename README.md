THIS IS A SIMPLE IoT BASED  GROUP PROJECT WHICH AIMS TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES FACED IN THE CURRENT MANPOWER BASED PARKING SYSTEMS. HERE THE USER CAN GET INFORMATION REGARDING THE PARKING SLOT AVAILABILITY AT THE ENTRY POINT ITSELF SO THAT HE/SHE DOES NOT NEED TO WASTE THE TIME IN FINDING THE PARKING SPACE.THIS QUALITY OF THE PROJECT MAKES IT MORE EFFICIENT AND LABOUR-SAVING THAN THE TRADITIONAL PARKING SYSTEMS.
